# Bacterial-Gliding-Simulation
This project simulates adhesion-driven motion where surface units move along helical tracks, stochastically binding and unbinding. Direction changes arise when adhesion conditions trigger soft turns or sharp flips. The code logs trajectories, visualizes 2-D/3-D paths, and reports metrics like total turns and turns per body length.
